      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to help users visualize and organize their dream travel destinations in an engaging and dynamic way. The site offers inspiration and interactive features for exploring different types of travel experiences.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This site is for travel enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in discovering new destinations. It's particularly aimed at younger audiences who enjoy visual planning and interactive tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        The site will include an array of destination objects displayed as cards. Users will be able to filter destinations by continent or type (beach, city, nature). Each destination will include a button to “Add to My List,” which stores selections using <code>localStorage</code>. Badges like “Visited” or “High Priority” will display based on destination properties, using conditional logic.
